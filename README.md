## How It Works

### File Structure

- `public/`: Contains static files, including downloaded chapters and cover images.
- `views/`: Contains EJS templates for rendering the web interface.
- `index.js`: Main Node.js script.

### Main Components

- **Express Server**: Serves the web interface and handles API requests.
- **Axios**: Used for HTTP requests to fetch web novel content.
- **Cheerio**: Parses and extracts content from HTML.
- **WebSocket**: Provides real-time updates on download progress.
- **epub-gen**: Compiles downloaded chapters into an EPUB format.

### Endpoints

- `GET /`: Serves the main web interface.
- `POST /download`: Initiates the download process using the provided start URL.

### Functions

- `fetchChapter(url, sendUpdate)`: Fetches a single chapter and returns its content and the URL for the next chapter.
- `saveChapter(content, chapterNumber, directory, sendUpdate)`: Saves the fetched chapter as an HTML file.
- `downloadCoverImage(coverUrl, directory, sendUpdate)`: Downloads the cover image.
- `createEpub(title, author, directory, sendUpdate)`: Compiles downloaded chapters into an EPUB.
- `downloadChapters(title, author, startUrl, chapterRange, coverUrl, sendUpdate)`: Manages the download process for the chapters.
- `getTitlePage(url, sendUpdate)`: Fetches the title page to extract novel metadata.

## Example

To download a novel, use its start URL in the web interface, for example:

```
Title Page: 
https://example.com/novel/123/
```
